## ----IMPORTANT----
### Unzip the `env.rar` file which I attached in the email and get `.env` file
### Put the `.env` file in the top-level directory before running the application. It has all the parameters and authentication needed to request tickets from API and run the application.
### Then type `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all the python packages needed for the application.

### After put the `.env` in the top-level directory and install the needed packages. 
### Type `flask run` to start the web viewer on your localhost. Use the url showed on your terminal to access the web viewer.
## ----Personalize----
You can change the environment argument in .env to personalize the application.
For instance: change `SUB_DOMAIN, EMAIL_ADDRESS, API_TOKEN` to request for the tickets of your own account or change `TICKETS_PER_PAGE` to set up how many tickets are showing in one page.
